    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a keeper! One of the best recipes I have made in a long, long time. Perfect as is - no changes are needed at all. Make sure your scallops are really dry - season them well and into a screaming hot pan. Don't move them until you flip them. You want to get them good and crispy on the outside. So delicious! Try them - you won't regret making this recipe! Enjoy!</p>
